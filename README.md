---
Matlab codes for our paper **Learning to Diffuse: A New Perspective to Design PDEs for Visual Analysis**.


### How to start
---
You can directly try *script_LTD_segment.m* to check the LTD segmentation results. 
### Hardware/software requirements
---
0 The codes are tested in Windows 7 (we use the Windows command line based executable for superpixel generation) 

1 Matlab 2013b or later
